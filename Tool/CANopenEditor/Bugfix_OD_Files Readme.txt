Problems with Turkish characters. Namely,

'ı' instead of 'i'
'İ' instead of 'I'

Some ".attribute = ," content being empty
Disappearance of "define" symbols in "OD.h"
So I wrote a simple 'python' code. If you run it where your OD.c and OD.h files are, it will make the necessary changes.

You can make minor changes to the python code if there are different bugs that need to be changed.
